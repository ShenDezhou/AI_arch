abstract = {Computational prediction of a movie's financial success usually relies only on metadata such as - genre, budget, actors, Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rating and critics' reviews. We argue that movie trailers, created to invoke viewers' interest and curiosity about a movie, carry complementary information for predicting a movie's financial future. We created a database consisting of 474 American movie trailers along with various metadata and information about movie's financial success in the opening weekend. A number of features that capture the emotional information contained in the audiovisual stream of the trailers are designed and extracted. We observe that the content-based features have as much predictive information as the meta features. Through regression analysis on our database, we show that signal information from trailer content improves the prediction performance.},

In this paper, we utilize EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm to divide movies into several groups, and then for each group we learn one model to predict movie box-office revenue separately. Experimental results show that using multiple models (Multi-model) can obtain more accurate prediction than using a single model (Single-model).},

Drawing on a sample of widely distributed movies from 2000 to 2009 (n = 974), we test whether the box office under-performance of films with an independent female presence results primarily from “downstream” public rejection or from an gendered “upstream” division of resources that provides greater studio support to movies about men. Using a series of multivariate regression analyses and controlling for genre, critical appraisal, arthouse label, being a sequel, and including a popular star, films with a female presence earn less at the box office. This effect, however, appears to be largely the consequence of movies that feature women having smaller production budgets, suggesting that the underrepresentation of women in film stems from “upstream” routines of film industry gatekeepers, not a lesser interest in stories about women in the minds of the public.},

And yet, the content that is generated from these websites remains largely untapped by official authorities. The present tutorial investigates techniques for social media modeling, analytics and optimization. First we present methods for collecting large scale social media data and then discuss techniques for coping with and correcting for the effects arising from missing and incomplete data. In this paper, we show how social media content can be used to predict real-world outcomes. In particular, we use the chatter from Twitter.com to forecast box-office revenues for movies. We show that a simple model built from the rate at which tweets are created about particular topics can outperform market-based calculations. We further demonstrate how sentiments extracted from Twitter can be further utilized to improve the forecasting power of social media. We summarize an effort to predict box office revenues using Twitter data. It is hypothesized that an increased number of tweets about a movie before its release will result in increased box office revenue.},

abstract = {In the era of big data, logistic planning can be made data-driven to take advantage of accumulated knowledge in the past. While in the movie industry, movie planning can also exploit the existing online movie knowledge library to achieve better results. However, it is ineffective to solely rely on conventional heuristics for movie planning, due to a large number of existing movies and various real-world factors that contribute to the success of each movie, such as the movie genre, available budget, production team (involving actor, actress, director, and writer), etc. In this paper, we study a &raquo;Blockbuster Planning&raquo; (BP) problem to learn from previous movies and plan for low budget yet high return new movies in a totally data-driven fashion. After a thorough investigation of an online movie knowledge library, a novel movie planning framework &raquo;Blockbuster Planning with Maximized Movie Configuration Acquaintance&raquo; (BigMovie) is introduced in this paper. From the investment perspective, BigMovie maximizes the estimated gross of the planned movies with a given budget. Meanwhile, from the production team's perspective, BigMovie is able to formulate an optimized team with people/movie genres that team members are acquainted with. We formulate the BP problem as a non-linear binary programming problem and prove its NP-hardness. To solve it in polynomial time, BigMovie relaxes the hard binary constraints and addresses the BP problem as a cubic programming problem.

All of these movies have different budgets and different cast crew but one thing in common all want to make profit from movies i.e. make a good box office record. Success of a movie depends on various factors of past and present. Identifying the right factors can predict the profitability of a movie. Some of the factors in predicting movie success are budget, actors, director, producer, IMDb rating, IMDb metascore, IMDb vote count, rotten tomator’s tomatometer, actors and director social fan following, wikipedia views, trailer views etc.. The success prediction of a movies plays an indispensable job in film industry since it includes immense investments. Be that as it may, success can not be predicted based on a specific property of a movie. To predict success one have to consider all the properties which can affect movie’s success and see how these properties affecting movie’s success over time. In this paper, researchers proposed a model where they consider several factors, each factor is assigned by a weight and success/failure of the upcoming movies is predicted based on the factor’s value.},

A number of attributes such as cast, genre, budget, production house, PG rating affect the popularity of a movie. Social media such as Twitter, YouTube etc. are major platforms where people can share their views about the movies. This paper describes experiments in predictive analysis using machine learning algorithms on both conventional features, collected from movies databases on Web as well as social media features (text comments on YouTube, Tweets). The results demonstrate that the sentiments harnessed from social media and other social media features can predict the success with more accuracy than that of using conventional features. We achieved best value of 77% and 61% using selected social media features for Rating and Income prediction respectively, whereas selected conventional features gave results of 76.2% and 52% respectively. More it was found that the blend of both types of attributes (conventional and those collected from social media) can outperform the existing approaches in this domain.},

In this paper, we have prepared a dataset of 7988 movie trailers from YouTube. The dataset contains different attributes like opening income, number of views, number of likes, number of dislikes, number of comments. We prepared two prediction models and applied four regression techniques to find out the most suitable technique for predicting the gross income of a movie. The comparative analysis has depicted that linear regression is the most suitable method regarding the prediction of movies gross income using these attributes.

Studies have suggested that public emotions shown through Tweeter may well be correlated with the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, can public sentiment be analyzed to predict the movements of the stock price of a particular company? If so, is it possible for the stock price of one company to be more predictable than that of another company? Is there a particular kind of companies whose stock price are more predictable based on analyzing public sentiments as reflected in Twitter data? In this article, we propose a method to mine Twitter data for answers to these questions. Specifically, we propose to use a data mining algorithm to determine if the price of a selection of 30 companies listed in NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange can actually be predicted by the given 15 million records of tweets (i.e., Twitter messages). We do so by extracting ambiguous textual tweet data through NLP techniques to define public sentiment, then make use of a data mining technique to discover patterns between public sentiment and real stock price movements. With the proposed algorithm, we manage to discover that it is possible for the stock closing price of some companies to be predicted with an average accuracy as high as 76.12%. In this paper, we describe the data mining algorithm that we use and discuss the key findings in relation to the questions posed.},

A natural application of this would be the prediction of the society's reaction to a new product in the sense of popularity and adoption rate. However, bridging the gap between “real time monitoring” and “early predicting” remains a big challenge. Here we report on an endeavor to build a minimalistic predictive model for the financial success of movies based on collective activity data of online users. We show that the popularity of a movie can be predicted much before its release by measuring and analyzing the activity level of editors and viewers of the corresponding entry to the movie in Wikipedia, the well-known online encyclopedia.},

To assess the demand of a product we need to track its order behavior and predict the future response of customers depending on the present dataset as well as historical dataset.

abstract = {This is a survey of web crawling. While at first glance web crawling may appear to be merely an application of breadth-first-search, the truth is that there are many challenges ranging from systems concerns such as managing very large data structures to theoretical questions such ashow often to revisit evolving content sources. However, due to the large volume of web resources and the dynamic nature of deep web, achieving large coverage and high efficiency is a challenging issue. We propose a two stage framework, namely Smart-Crawler, for efficient harvesting wide web interfaces. In the first stage, it is site based searching for center pages with the help of search engines, it avoid visiting large number of pages. To achieve more accurate results for a focused crawl, it is ranking the websites to prioritize highly relevant ones for a given topic. In the second step, It searches fast insite searching by extracting most relevant link s with an adaptive link-ranking. To eliminate bias on visiting some it also contain highly relevant link s in hidden web directories, we design a link tree data structure to achieve wider coverage for a website.},

So to make the movie profitable, it becomes a matter of concern that the movie succeeds. Given the low success rate, models and mechanisms to predict reliably the ranking and or box office collections of a movie can help de-risk the business significantly and increase average returns. The current predictive models available are based on various factors for assessment of the movie. These include the classical factors such as cast, producer, director etc. or the social factors in form of response of the society on various online platforms. This methodology lacks to harvest the required accuracy level. Our paper suggests that the integration of both the classical and the social factors (anticipation and user feedback) and the study of interrelation among the classical factors will lead to more accuracy.},

abstract = {In this project, we developed a mathematical model to predict the success and failure of the upcoming movies based on several attributes. Some of the criteria in calculating movie success included budget, actors, director, producer, set locations, story writer, movie release day, competing movie releases at the same time, music, release location and target audience. The success prediction of a movie plays a vital role in movie industry because it involves huge investments. However, success cannot be predicted based on a particular attribute. So, we have built a model based on interesting relation between attributes. The movie industry can use this model to modify the movie criteria for obtaining likelihood of blockbusters. Also, this model can be used by movie watchers in determining a blockbuster before purchasing a ticket. Each of the criteria involved was given a weight and then the prediction was made based on these. For example, if a movies budget was below 5 million, the budget was given a lower weight. Depending on the number of actors, directors and producers past successful movies, each of these categories was given a weight. If the movie was to be released on a weekend, it was given higher weight because the chances of success were greater. If with the release of a movie, there was another high success movie released, a lower weight was given to the release time indicating that the chances of movie success were low due to the competition. The criteria were not limited just to the ones mentioned. There were be additional factors discussed in this work. We have conducted our work with simulation data.},

Recently however, the “Wisdom of Crowd” and social media have been acknowledged as a strong signal in understanding consumer behavior towards media. In this paper, we discuss the impact of socially generated meta-data mined from the social multimedia sites and study the influence of social media on box- office performance and profitability of movies. Our result shows that various social media signals have varying yet significant impact in predicting the performance of movies. Our research also reveals that popularity of actor captured by follower count on Twitter is most relevant to the success of movie at theaters, and Facebook `like' signal has noise which impedes its analytical credibility.},

abstract = {Presently, analysis of opinions from social media (Twitter) has become very popular merely because such an amount of views is difficult to extract through any other existing custom means of collecting views like surveys, polls etc. The analysis is interesting but at the same time challenging because of a micro blog post generate information on Internet and number of opinions can be expressed which are usually very short and colloquial and choosing the best opinion mining algorithms is very difficult in such type of text. Therefore, we propose a new system which automatically analyzes the sentiments of these types of messages using major classification algorithms. Here we consider Twitter for the task of sentiment analysis which can play significant role on the popularity of the products and services. Hence, an accurate method for predicting sentiments could enable us to understand customers' preferences, their views on the product and services offered by the companies. Companies and organization can use this information to formulate the future planning. These can possibly make positive or negative wave in the business sectors as well as social sectors. The primary center of my proposed work is to analyze the emotions communicated on social networking Twitter so that peoples’ feelings, habits and choices are extracted, investigated and used to understand the behavior of the people.},

We test our method using 325 films from the United States and then apply it to films from four foreign markets: Japan (95 films), Australia (118 films), Germany (105 films), and the United Kingdom (141 films). We find the technique to have inconsistent performance in these nations. While it makes relatively accurate predictions for the United States and Australia, its predictions in the remaining markets are not accurate enough to be useful.},

The main goal of this paper is to conduct performance comparison among various machine learning methods. We choose seven machine learning techniques for this comparison such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, AdaBoost and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). All of these methods predict an approximate net profit value of a movie by analyzing historical data from different sources like IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Box Office Mojo and Meta Critic. For all these seven methods, the system predicts a movie box office profit based on some pre-released features and post-released features. This paper analyzes the performance assessment of all these seven machine learning techniques based on our own dataset which contains 755 movies. Among these seven algorithms, Multilayer perceptron Neural Network gives better result.},

abstract = {Every year the number of movie produced and released surpass the previous year's count and so do the total box office collections. So in this quality centric industry, it becomes imperative that the movie succeeds both in terms of box office collections and critical reviews and also renders profit. Due to advent of predictive analytics and big data generated through various social interactions, models to predict accurately the total gross of a movie can be devised, which eventually help the movie studio by giving constructive feedback both in pre-production and post-production phase. So the availability of this data gathered from various social platforms like IMDb, YouTube and Wikipedia can help to gauge the society's reaction and response towards a particular movie. It can also foretell a society's anticipation towards a particular movie. In this paper, we have built predictive models by establishing links between classical features, social media features and the overall success of the movie which includes total box office collection and the critics rating or review. The results show that the prediction model built using integration of classical as well as social factors can achieve higher accuracy rate.},

In contrast to most existing models that completely neglect user preferences, our approach allows us to model the most important source for movie success: moviegoer taste and behavior. We divide the problem into three distinct stages: (i) we use matrix factorization recommenders to model each user's taste, (ii) we then predict the individual consumption behavior, and (iii) eventually aggregate users to predict the box office result. We compare our approach to the current industry standard and show that the inclusion of user rating data reduces the error by a factor of 2x and outperforms recently published research.},
