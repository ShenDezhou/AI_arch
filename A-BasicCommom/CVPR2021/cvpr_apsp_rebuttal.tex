\section{Introduction}


Greetings to Reviewers,

I wrote this paper for seven reasons:

1) APSP is a well-known problem that has been studied since 1962, and no scientific advance in recent twenty years for its mathematical challenge;

2) I found that this algorithm can solve the APSP problem for a 10-thousand-node network in 60 seconds;

3) With my finding, by a desktop computation capability, users in the community can find everyone else's optimal paths in a blink of time.

4) It has four simple and generally applicable ideas for the shortest path problem;

5) It uses cutting-edge computational hardware;

6) It beats all published results on a standard dataset of social network;

7) It's three order of magnitude faster than the competing methods.

Accepting this paper shall save the time of everyone in the science community, physics, computer, and math scientists shall save the significant computational cost and finally make the planet a better greener place.


Cheers,

The Author.
